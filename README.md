# Biodiversity Impact Assessment for Investors: Supporting Analysis

This repository contains the code and data used for the paper, "Making money talk nicely: Biodiversity impact assessment for investors." It provides the analytical pipeline, data anonymisation scripts, and the anonymised dataset to ensure reproducibility of the findings.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

-   `analysis_code.qmd`: The original Quarto document containing the complete analysis code used for the paper.
-   `msci_gist_correlation_analysis.qmd`: A Quarto document specifically dedicated to exploring and disentangling the correlation between GIST and MSCI biodiversity metrics.
-   `_targets.R`: The `targets` pipeline script that defines and manages the entire data processing and analysis workflow, ensuring reproducibility and efficient execution.
-   `data_anonymiser.R`: An R script designed to anonymize the raw dataset, enabling the sharing of a reproducible analysis without compromising proprietary or sensitive information.
-   `dat_anonymised.csv`: The anonymised dataset generated by `data_anonymiser.R`. This dataset allows for the reproduction of the analysis presented in the paper.
-   `analysis_code_anonymised.qmd`: An adjusted version of the analysis code that specifically utilizes the `dat_anonymised.csv` file, demonstrating how to reproduce the analysis with the publically available data.
